# Student Grade Calculator

## Description

In this exercise, we'll learn how to work with Apache POI to create an Excel file.

## Tasks

Before you start your work, take a look at the **Student.java** class and make yourself familiar with it's methods and fields. The class is a simple storage class that will provide us with a way to track the grades of multiple students (i.e. individual objects).

You'll find a List of *Students* already prepared in the Exercise.java file. 

> Check the [official guides](https://poi.apache.org/components/spreadsheet/quick-guide.html) for pointers to the correct API classes and methods.

### Creating a Workbook
Import the apoache-poi libraries (in lib/) and create a Workbook that contains the grades for all students in a table. Write that workbook to the file *StudentGrades.xlsx*.

* Make sure that the header row is visibly different e.g. by using bold text
* Make sure that the columns have adequate width's to fit all information

The created excel sheet should look similar to the StudentGradesExample.xlsx
